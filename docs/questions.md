# Clarifying Questions — I need these answers to produce precise financials, legal recommendations, and prioritized product scope

1) Market & customer data
- How many active occupational therapists (OTs) do you estimate in Tehran and nationally? Any existing lists or association contacts?
- Do you have data on average monthly income for an independent OT in Tehran or other target cities?

2) Legal & compliance
- Have you already engaged local legal counsel for telemedicine or data protection? If so, can you share major constraints they flagged?
- Is there any existing institutional partner (hospital/university/association) willing to pilot and sign an MoU?

3) Infrastructure & operations
- Do you prefer self-hosting on owned servers vs. local cloud providers? Any current vendor relationships (data center, ISP)?
- Do you have access to any local TURN/STUN servers or a devops person who can manage media servers?

4) Payments & billing
- Have you integrated with any Iranian PSPs before? Which (ZarinPal, Pay.ir, or bank-specific gateways)?
- Will you accept subscriptions via recurring card payments, manual bank transfers, or both?

5) Team & resources
- Budget / runway available for the next 12 months? (rough figure)
- Will Rasoul be full-time for development? Planned hires in next 3 months?

6) Clinical content & AI
- Does Saba have an initial set of Farsi clinical templates, exercise libraries or assessment forms that can be digitized for Phase 1?
- Are you open to using open-source Persian STT (e.g., Whisper) or are you considering third-party Persian STT providers?

7) Product scope priorities
- Among scheduling, notes, telehealth, exercise prescription, payments — which two MUST be in Phase 1 for you to pilot with therapists?

8) Commercial constraints
- Target price sensitivity: would you prefer low-cost rapid adoption (low ARPU) or higher ARPU with targeted clinics and stronger onboarding?

9) Data-sharing & future AI training
- Would pilots allow collection of anonymized data for model improvement? (Requires explicit consent.)

Answering these will let me:
- produce suggested concrete IRR pricing tiers tied to therapist income,
- produce a sprint-level dev plan and required headcount,
- draft a 10-slide investor pitch with financials and use-of-funds.
